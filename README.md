## 🔍 **How It Works**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Medical images are preprocessed using normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques.
2. **Model Training**:  
   - SegFormer is fine-tuned on a dataset of annotated cancer images.
3. **Evaluation**:  
   - The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like Dice Coefficient, IoU, and Accuracy.
4. **Segmentation Visualization**:  
   - Segmented regions are overlaid on original images for clear tumor localization.

---

## 📊 **Results**
- Achieved a **high segmentation accuracy** with minimal false positives and false negatives.
- Demonstrated reliable tumor detection on a validation dataset.
- Output examples are provided in the `results/` folder.
